# i-POP-Interpretable---Probability-of-Payment-model
The Probability of Payment (POP) model is a risk scoring model that calculates a POP estimate for each  credit contract at origination.
Inherently interpretable models provide accurate explanation but sacrifice model performance to an extent.To combat, we developed a high-performing intrinsically interpretable POP model (i-pop) using an explainable neural network (xNN)  based on Generalized Additive Models with structured Interactions ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40602129/219272057-d61b451e-d559-4bb0-8efa-b3ab24ea23b5.png)
