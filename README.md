# i-POP-Interpretable---Probability-of-Payment-model

- The Probability of Payment (POP) model is a risk scoring model that calculates a POP estimate for each  credit contract at origination.
- Inherently interpretable models provide accurate explanation but sacrifice model performance to an extent.
- To combat, we developed a high-performing intrinsically interpretable POP model (i-pop) using an explainable neural network (xNN)  based on Generalized Additive Models   with structured Interactions (Yang et al,2021).   
- ROC (train -95.81 % & test -81.4 %) show that i-pop model has high discriminatory power than the current models.
- DeLong's test show that the AUCs of the current and previous models are statistically different.
- The model is deployed in the GCP -Vertex AI environment.
